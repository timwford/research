# research/

* README.md - this
* requirements.txt - Pip venv requirements (maybe help to come on site if I feel like it or someone wants it)
* abstract.odt - My abstract for the presentation

# research/tensor functions (matlab)

Holds all the original Tensor Operations we were given from Matlab. Someone else's work, attribution to them is buried in those files at the header I believe.

* 22matrix.m - test 2x2 matrix in matlab
* /matlab - all of the matlab functions

# research/networkGenerate

* epidemic models.pdf - paper given to go off of (someone elses' work)
* Social Network Generation.ipynb/pdf - my attempt at some network generation

# research/mar

Work on the matrix version of an ARMA model.

* generateData.py - generate data for testing a MAR (don't remember if this was useful or not)
* model.py - a fairly built out object oriented MAR, but it's not complete and doesn't work

# research/communitytSVD

* /coloringCommunities - an tsvd project where the two distinct communities were colored
* /firstRun - first attempt at doing a tsvd with two distinct communities
* /matlab - matlab files used for testing
* .ipynb files - Various iterations of getting results
* L_svd.py and L_trans.py - code stolen from Riley I believe (github: https://github.com/VintageDesign)
* tensorOps.py - the tensor operations converted from matlab to python (everything in here should work!)

# research/armaModel

Initial exploration/learning in time forecasting using an ARMA model. Essentially building one from scratch, using maximum likelihood.
